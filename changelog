Changelog 1.10 - 9/28/2024 --
 Additions
     Difficulty Calculator
          When you press the button, it calculates the overall map difficulty.
          It also puts the difficulty in a red color under each note, calculated based on a lot of things but most importantly:
                       the notes behind it, if you are curious why they look too high or too low sometimes, that is the reason.
 Removals
     Jump to MS is gone, dunno why that was there.
     The text that told you to look up how to use the features is gone, as it is obvious. (Really, why did I put that there?)
     Set Comparison Button. (It is now always active.)
     Delete/Add Alternate Button 
          It now places colors on alternates based on the alternates textbox.
          This also means that you can't insert alternates anymore, I believe this drawback is necessary for simplicity.
     Confirm Delete Button
          I'm sure that you know what you're doing when you press delete!
          Please don't misclick the button, whatever you do!
 Major Changes
     Streamlined the process of using layers and assigning notes to them
          Layers no longer have to be created in the menu, it will just be a place for showing that you have them.
          You can still create layers using the menu, if you desire.
          You can now assign notes to a layer using a keybind. (Default: F)
     Add/Delete Color now works more intuitively
          Selecting a color with the text boxes now shows a highlight where you are pointing at to show where it will place the color.
          Adding/Deleting notes will create and delete layers/alternates for you.
     Fixed the quantum snapping.
          It used to be linked to the top left note, now it works just like 2.0 editor. (I stole the code, I hope you don't mind.)
     Fixed Layer 0 fade for REAL this time.
          I didn't notice the problem at first and almost didn't fix it!
          The fade started on the note right before the second color
           which was hard to notice since I wasn't trying to do anything with purpose.
          It works properly now, so do not worry.
     When clicking on a text box, the text is now deleted automatically.
          If you click off without typing anything, it will return to what it was before you clicked.
          This is done because in no circumstance when clicking on those boxes have I wanted to NOT delete the text.
          Sometimes I just want to add, but typing numbers is faster overall than deleting them.
          Note: You will have to type the # for hexcodes manually but that shouldn't be too much trouble since most of the time the copy paste has it anyway.
 Minor Changes
     Made the waveform line 1.4 size instead of 2 because it felt too fuzzy.
     Made the size of the keybinds in the grid 0.75x size.
     Made the timeline less laggy (It rendered a quad for EVERY NOTE?? now it only does it if it can't render one on that pixel.)
     Made the timeline color based on what color the note is. (This adds a little lag back, sorry not sorry it looks kinda neat.)
     Moved the SFX Offset box to the Timing section in the editor, where it should be.
     Made the colors of the grid closer to 2.0 editor since I like those more.
     Made the quantum lines actually work properly. (like avi's editor :D)
     Made the color sliders default to 255 when opening instead of being in the middle.
     Made the color textboxes default to 255 when opening instead of being 0.

- fixed the horrendous lag when using more than ~1000 notes
